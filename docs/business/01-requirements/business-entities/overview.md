# Business Entities Overview

## System Overview
The Monitoring Camera System is a comprehensive security and surveillance solution designed to provide real-time monitoring, recording, and management of camera feeds across multiple locations. The system supports various camera types, user roles, and advanced features for enhanced security management.

## Core Business Entities

### 1. User Management
- **Admin**: System administrators with full access to all features and configurations
- **Operator**: Users responsible for monitoring and basic camera operations
- **Viewer**: Limited access users who can only view designated camera feeds
- **Guest**: Temporary access users with restricted viewing permissions

### 2. Camera Infrastructure
- **IP Cameras**: Network-connected cameras with digital streaming capabilities
- **Analog Cameras**: Traditional CCTV cameras requiring conversion for digital processing
- **PTZ Cameras**: Pan-Tilt-Zoom cameras with remote directional control
- **Fixed Cameras**: Stationary cameras with fixed viewing angles
- **Mobile Cameras**: Portable or vehicle-mounted surveillance units

### 3. Location Management
- **Sites**: Physical locations or facilities under surveillance
- **Zones**: Specific areas within sites (e.g., entrance, parking, warehouse)
- **Camera Groups**: Logical groupings of cameras for management purposes
- **Coverage Areas**: Defined surveillance perimeters and blind spots

### 4. Recording & Storage
- **Live Streams**: Real-time video feeds from active cameras
- **Recorded Footage**: Stored video data with timestamps and metadata
- **Storage Devices**: Local and cloud storage solutions for video data
- **Backup Systems**: Redundant storage for critical footage preservation

### 5. Monitoring Operations
- **Monitoring Sessions**: Active surveillance periods with assigned operators
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Automated warnings for security events
- **Incident Reports**: Documented security events and responses
- **Maintenance Logs**: Camera and system maintenance records

### 6. System Configuration
- **Camera Settings**: Resolution, frame rate, recording schedules
- **User Permissions**: Access control and role-based restrictions
- **Network Configuration**: IP addresses, bandwidth allocation, connectivity
- **Security Policies**: Authentication, encryption, and access protocols

## Entity Relationships

### Primary Relationships
- Users are assigned to specific Sites and Zones
- Cameras belong to Sites and are grouped by Zones
- Recording Sessions are linked to specific Cameras and Users
- Alerts are generated by Cameras and assigned to Users
- Incidents are created from Alerts and managed by Operators

### Data Flow
1. Cameras capture video feeds within assigned Zones
2. Live streams are monitored by assigned Operators
3. Recording systems store footage based on configured policies
4. Alert systems notify relevant Users of security events
5. Incident management tracks and resolves security issues

## Business Rules

### Access Control
- Users can only access cameras within their assigned permissions
- Guest access requires approval and has time-limited sessions
- Admin users have override capabilities for emergency situations

### Recording Policies
- Critical zones require 24/7 recording with extended retention
- Standard zones follow scheduled recording based on operational hours
- Storage allocation is managed based on camera priority and zone importance

### Alert Management
- High-priority alerts require immediate operator response
- Alert escalation follows defined hierarchy and time thresholds
- All alerts must be acknowledged and resolved with proper documentation

## Integration Points

### External Systems
- **Access Control Systems**: Integration with door locks and entry points
- **Fire Safety Systems**: Coordination with smoke detectors and alarms
- **Building Management**: Integration with HVAC and lighting controls
- **Security Services**: Connection to external monitoring centers

### Data Exchange
- **Video Analytics**: AI-powered motion detection and behavior analysis
- **Mobile Applications**: Remote monitoring and alert notifications
- **Reporting Systems**: Automated generation of security and compliance reports
- **Backup Services**: Automated data replication to off-site storage

## Compliance & Standards
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR compliance for video data handling and storage
- **Security Standards**: ISO 27001 compliance for information security
- **Industry Regulations**: Adherence to local surveillance and privacy laws
- **Audit Requirements**: Comprehensive logging for compliance verification
